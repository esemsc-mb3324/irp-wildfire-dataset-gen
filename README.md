# irp-wildfire-dataset-gen
For chpa-214, a repository that contains information and scripts for generating a dataset for wildfire modeling.

## Overview
This repository serves as a reference for generating comprehensive datasets using ELMFIRE (Eulerian Level Set Model of Fire spread) to train deep learning models for wildfire behavior prediction. The approach is inspired by two key research efforts: the Google Research/USFS collaboration on high-resolution 1D fire modeling and established standards in wildfire machine learning research.

## Basics
- First dataset:
  - Single ignition in middle 50% of domain

## Table of Contents
**/elmfire-documentation:**
- Contains information from the Elmfire site and tutorials

**/papers**
- Contains the papers used as refrerences for this dataset

**wx.csv**
- Contains the parameter specifics for the given simulation
- File is updated by mult_sims.sh before running a new simulation

**01-run**
- The bash file for running Elmfire, called by mult_runs.sh
- Provides specifications for single simulations (mult_runs.sh calls this file multiple times)

**01-run-timesteps**
- Specifies the simulation times for which to run 01-run
- Essentially determines the timesteps for each individual simulation

**0N-sims**
- Updates wx.csv after a single simulation has been run and calls 01-sim-timesteps to
  generate outputs for the next simulation

**0N-sims-post**
- Runs the postprocessing script on the outputs generated by 0N-sims

## Research Foundation for Generating Dataset
**1. Recurrent Convolutional Deep Neural Networks for Modeling Time-Resolved Wildfire Spread Behavior – Burge et al. (Google Research)**
- **Basics**
  - FARSITE
  - 40,000 simulations
  - 80:10:10 split (train/val/test)
  - Convergence defined to be earliest pt at which val loss stopped improving for 24hr of clock time
  - L1, L2 regularization and dropout not helpful
  - 128x128 cells with cell size of 30m = 3840x3840
  - 72hr sims with 15min time step —> 289 timesteps/sequence
      - Also tested 30min and 60min timesteps
  - 17 channels: 
      - The first three channels were derived from the burn fraction described above: (1) vegetation, the fraction of vegetation that remains unburnt, (2) fire_front, the fraction of vegetation that burned in the previous time step, and (3) scar, the fraction of vegetation that is currently burnt.
      - The remaining 14: inputs tracked by FARSITE
  - Parameters held constant intra-simulation (except for the fourth wind-varying dataset) but varied inter-simulation
  - Finney used to calculate crown fire potential (foliar moisture=100%)
  - Spotting not considered
  - Starting loc of each fire selected to be within central 50% of field
  - Octoganal fire front of 75m (2% of field) placed at central location
  - One cell was trimmed from the border, resulting in a final field size of 126x126 cells.
  - Prediction:
    - Postprocessing: after each prediction, negative results clipped to prevent invalid predictions. DCIGN results were regularized.
    - Both 6hr and 24hr autoregressive predictions generated
  - Confidence intervals: determined by bootstrapping 20 new sequences by randomly sampling fire seqs from the 1000 seqs in og test dataset
  - **Results:** Presented results showing ave error
    - Presented results of both scar and fire front jaccard, RMSE, and STE metrics for both the EPD and EPD-ConvLSTM models for time steps of 15, 30, and 60min
- **Timings**
  - Inference time:
    - EPD model takes ~7ms for one inference
    - EPD-ConvLSTM model takes ~61ms to perform the same inference
    - FARSITE takes between 20 ms and 100 ms (depending on how much fire is in the patch)
  - Dataset generation:
    - Generation: on hpc with each sim taking 30s to run – 330 CPU hours (12,000 on 36 core processors)
    - Postprocessing: 17,000 core hours
    - Total: 29,000 core-hours
  - Training (16cpus, 8gpus):
    - Single fuel:
      - EPD model: ~4 days
      - EPD-ConvLSTM model: ~6 days
    - Multiple fuel and California datasets:
      - EPD model: ~8 days
      - EPD-ConvLSTM model: ~13 days
- **Results** (100 autoregressive predictions; 24hr of simulated fire spread):
  - Stable dynamics and Jaccard score between 0.89 and 0.94 for predicted fire scar
- **Datasets (FARSITE):**
  - Single fuel: every simulation used same fuel model. All other parameters held uniform across landscape, but vary randomly across simulations (TLDR: changing parameters without spatial variation)
  - Multiple fuel: generated identically to single fuel, but for each sequence, random fuel model used for entire domain (TLDR: far less training data per fuel type than in single fuel)
  - California: real-world landscape LCP 40 data obtained using LANDFIRE for continental US. For each simulation, a random 128x128 portion of California + some of Nevada was selected (resampled if <70% burnable fuel available)
  - California (WN): generated identically to california dataset but with spatially varying wind. INTERESTING NOTE: “Only prevailing wind was provided to DNN models to reflect the sparse availalbility of such data in real-world applications."

### Dataset Complexity Progression

# Google #
1. **Level 1 (Single Fuel)**: Homogeneous fuel type (GR1 grass), one spot fire, uniform parameters across landscape but varying randomly across simulations
2. **Level 2 (Multiple Fuel)**: Random fuel model used for entire domain, resulting in ~40x less coverage per fuel type combination
3. **Level 3 (California)**: Real-world heterogeneous landscapes from LANDFIRE data, complex fuel arrangements
4. **Level 4 (California-WN)**: Spatially-varying wind patterns computed by WindNinja based on topography

### Level 1 Dataset: Single Fuel (Proof of Concept)

**Target Size**: 10,000 simulations

**Design Philosophy**: Following the Google Research single fuel dataset approach - homogeneous fuel type across entire landscape with uniform parameters per simulation, but randomly varying parameters across different simulations.

**Fixed Parameters:**
- **Fuel Type**: Single FBFM40 model (recommend FBFM1: Short grass, following Google's GR1 choice)
- **Topography**: Planar terrain with constant slope and aspect per simulation
- **Canopy**: Minimal canopy cover (0-5%)
- **Domain Size**: 128×128 cells at 300m resolution (~38km × 38km, smaller than Google's 30m for computational efficiency)

**Variable Parameters (Per Google Research Ranges):**

*Wind Conditions:*
- Wind speed: 0-50 km/h (Google's range)
- Wind direction: 0-360° (uniform distribution)
- Pattern: Constant wind during simulation

*Fuel Moisture:*
- 1-hr moisture: 2-40% (Google's range)

- Live woody: 30-100%

*Topography:*
- Slope: 0-45° (constant per domain)
- Aspect: 0-360° (constant per domain)

*Ignition:*
- Location: Random within central 50% of domain (following Google approach)
- Shape: Small octagonal fire front (~75m width, ~2% of domain width)
- Timing: Simulation start (t=0)

*Simulation Parameters:*
- Duration: 72 hours (following Google's approach)
- Output interval: 15 minutes (Google's time step)
- Total time steps: 289 (following Google's methodology)

```

### ELMFIRE Configuration Considerations

**Computational Domain:**
- Cellsize: 30m (balance between detail and computational cost; Google used 30m)
- Domain extent: ~38km × 38km (128×128 cells)
- Boundary conditions: Non-burnable boundaries (following Google approach)

**Simulation Settings:**
- Time step: 15 minutes (matching Google's approach)
- Stop criteria: 72 hours or domain boundary reached
- Output variables: `time_of_arrival`, `flin` (fireline intensity), `vs` (spread velocity)
- Burn fraction: Computed as fraction of burned region inside each cell (Google's approach)

**Quality Control:**
- Exclude simulations with numerical instabilities
- Filter unrealistic spread rates (>10 m/s)
- Validate against simplified analytical models (Rothermel equations)

### Validation Strategy
- Compare against historical fire perimeters
- Cross-validate with operational fire behavior models (FARSITE, FlamMap)
- Validate spread rates against field observations

## Dataset Output Structure

### File Organization
```
cases/
├── case_0.npz
├── case_1.npz
└── ...

Each case_X.npz contains:
- fire_data: (timesteps, channels, height, width)
  - Channel 0: Fireline intensity
  - Channel 1: Time of arrival  
  - Channel 2: Spread velocity
  - Channel 3: Fuel model
- metadata: Simulation parameters and geospatial info
```

### Metadata Schema
```python
metadata = {
    'channels': ['flin', 'time_of_arrival', 'vs', 'fuel_model'],
    'timesteps_in_case': [1800, 3600, 5400, ...],  # seconds
    'weather_params': {
        'wind_speed': float,
        'wind_direction': float,
        'fuel_moisture_1hr': float,
        # ... other parameters

        'extent': [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax],
        'projection': 'EPSG:...'
    }
}
```

## HPC Implementation Strategy

### Computational Requirements
- **Single simulation**: ~30-300 seconds (depending on domain size and complexity)
- **Target dataset (15,000 cases)**: ~1,250-3,750 CPU hours
- **Recommended approach**: Array jobs with 100-500 simulations per node

### Parallelization Strategy
```bash
# Example SLURM array job
#SBATCH --array=1-15000
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00

# Each array job runs one ELMFIRE simulation
case_id=$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
./run_single_case.sh $case_id
```

### Data Management
- **Storage requirements**: ~50GB for Level 1 dataset
- **Backup strategy**: Redundant storage of parameter files for reproducibility
- **Processing pipeline**: Automated quality control and case validation

## Getting Started
